# Status

Session-boot dashboard. Read this before doing anything; update it before
ending any session that changes a prototype's state. One line per prototype;
detail lives in each prototype's FINDINGS.md.

States: `idea → spec → building → testing → validated | falsified | parked`

## Dashboard

| ID | Prototype | State | Compute | Verdict (one line) |
|----|-----------|-------|---------|--------------------|
| 01 | [search-mcp (F1)](prototypes/01-search-mcp/SPEC.md) | **validated** | embeddings | Hybrid search clears bar (2009 R@10 0.868/MRR 0.766; 2004 0.951/0.823); MCP server live via `.mcp.json`. [FINDINGS](prototypes/01-search-mcp/FINDINGS.md) |

## Lessons

Cross-cutting learnings that should inform every future prototype. Add the
lesson, the prototype that surfaced it, and the date.

- **Ollama parallelism is config/version/architecture-dependent** — the lab
  found qwen-arch forced to `-np 1` on ollama 0.30.7, but parallel workers
  are currently configured on (Nick's later experiment). Don't assume either
  way: check the live config and `gpu_status()` before designing around
  parallelism, and re-test after ollama upgrades. *(cert_layoff_lab
  REFINEMENTS #2 + repo setup, 2026-06-12)*
- **Never call Claude from code** — `claude -p` shell calls bill at API
  rates; in-session Agent subagents use the subscription. Cloud fallback is
  therefore the subagent fan-out pattern (code writes batch inputs → main
  session spawns subagents → code merges/validates outputs), per
  cert_layoff_lab `annotate_summary.py`. *(repo setup, 2026-06-12)*
- **Silent truncation is the insidious LLM failure mode** — fixed context
  budgets fail invisibly on outlier-length inputs and the loss masquerades as
  quality problems. Size `num_ctx` dynamically and log loudly when a budget is
  exceeded. *(inherited from cert_layoff_lab REFINEMENTS #1)*
- **The gold holdings (1979–2015) are a first-class corpus**, not just eval
  scaffolding — 3,955 ALJ- and district-tagged holdings spanning 35 years,
  available before any production extraction runs. *(repo setup, 2026-06-12)*
- **arctic-l-v2 is the best open embedding model on both legal corpora
  tested** (FPPC benchmark and the layoff known-item eval); bge-large second.
  Use `Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-l-v2.0` with `query: ` prefix on
  queries only. *(01-search-mcp, 2026-06-12)*
- **De-identify at index/artifact build time, not at render time** — names
  then can't leak from any downstream consumer. Boundary: the lab's
  `deidentify` covers roster (respondent) names only; non-roster employee
  names survive. *(01-search-mcp, 2026-06-12)*
- **Known-item evals built from token-similarity alignments are biased
  toward BM25** — judge semantic retrieval on paraphrase queries too before
  concluding embeddings don't help. *(01-search-mcp, 2026-06-12)*
